Why this dataset and which presentation?

Chose to visualize the Olympics data set. For this information visualization, we decided to use a stacked bar chart. Stacked bar charts are simple to understand and their visual structure matches the structure of the data set provided. The stacked bar chart, in this info-vis, allows the user to not only see how many total medals a country has won, but also how many gold, silver, and bronze medals a country has won within that partial bar. The stacked bar chart  makes it easy to tell the difference between the total medal count of each country. They are great for showing the total because they visually aggregate all of the categories in a group. The downside is that it becomes harder to compare the sizes of the individual categories, which are the 3 types of medals (gold, silver, and bronze). Lastly, to make this an info-vis, not only did we visualize the data provided, but also added interaction i.e. if you hover over a bar, it will show the medal count. For example, if you hover over the US gold portion of bar, a tooltip will show and display the amount of gold medals US has won.

You can hover over the each bar to see what it represents (used tooltips) e.g. if you hover over the gold bar for US, it will show the gold medal count.
Since this visualization has a lot of countries (data) to portray on the vis, you will have to scroll horizontally. The legend is on the very right hand size.
The gold portion of the bar represents the amount of gold medals won by a country. The silver portion represents the amount of silver medals and the bronze portion represents the amount of bronze medals!
